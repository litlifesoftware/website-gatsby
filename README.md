Visit our *website* on [litlifesoftware.github.io](https://litlifesoftware.github.io).

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Checkout repository.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    # Clone the project onto your device
    git clone https://github.com/litlifesoftware/website-gatsby.git
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd website-gatsby/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `website-gatsby` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
